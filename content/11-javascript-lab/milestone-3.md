Follow the steps below to complete Milestone #3:

In your groups:

1. Complete the application by adding logic that changes the background image to reflect the converted temperature

- Example: If the converted temperature is 10 F (degrees) the background image should represent something cold

- Make the application your own - choose your own background images

Timebox: 20 to 30 minutes

Note: While you will be working within a group, each student should have their own copy of the project on their computers
