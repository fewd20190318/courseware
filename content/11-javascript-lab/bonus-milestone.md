Follow the steps below to complete the Bonus Milestone:

1. Add logic that also allows users to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius (currently the application only converts from Celsius to Fahrenheit)

2. Add logic that displays an error message when the user enters a non number (for example:  when users enter a letter or a special character such as "#" or "$" into the text field and tries to calculate the temperature conversion)
