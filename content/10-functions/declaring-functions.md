## Declaring a Function

![inline](/images/10/declared_named_function_diagram.png)

- Use the `function` keyword to declare a function

- Functions can be given a name

- The name must be followed by parentheses

- The opening and closing curly braces indicate a “code block”

- The statements for your function goes within the code block

- Simply declaring the function **will not run this code**, this function must be “called” in order for the code inside the function to be run
