## What are Functions?

- Allows you to group a series of statements together to perform a specific task

- Functions are used to promote “code reuse”

- You can control when functions are executed, for example - you can write functions that only get executed (or called) when a user clicks a specific button



```js

// a simple function that greets you with a 'Good Morning' alert

// 1) Declare a function named greeting

function greeting(){
  alert('Good Morning');
};


// 2) Call (or run) the function

greeting();

```
