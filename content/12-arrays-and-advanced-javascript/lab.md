## Lab: Rock, Paper Scissors

- Using Sublime, open the folder called **rock_paper_scissors** (found within the **starter_code**) folder

- Instructions

  - Work in pairs/groups (each student should have their own copy of the app on your computers)

  - Review the completed version of the app (found in folder called **rock_paper_scissors_obfuscated**) to understand how the app is expected to work

  - Plan out your approach **before** coding (using pseudocode, whiteboarding, etc.)

  - Use console.log to print out values to console to help ensure you're on the right path
