- DOM stands for Document Object Model

- Browsers view our webpages as **documents**

- Browsers represents documents in a couple of ways

  - In the browser window as html
  - Through the DOM

- The DOM is just another way that our browser represents our documents


- We make our pages interactive by modifying the DOM

- Javascript is a scripting language that allows us to manipulate/modify the DOM
