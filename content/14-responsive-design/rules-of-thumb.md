- All text should be expressed in EMs / REMs

- Use percentages for Horizontal measurements

- Consider using ems/rems for margins & padding if you want them to increase and decrease in proportion to the font-size

- Consider using percentages for left and right margins and padding so they change in proportion to the width of the containing element

- Use pixels (absolute measurement) for height/margins/paddings **if you do not want** those measurements to change relative to screen size

 These rules **are not absolute** but having a standard approach speeds up development
