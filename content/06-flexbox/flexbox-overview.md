## What is Flexbox?

- New layout mode introduced with CSS3

- Allows developers to create flexible layouts without having to rely on floats or inline-block elements

- Is direction-agnostic as opposed to the regular layouts (block which is vertically-based and inline which is horizontally-based)

- Widely supported across all modern browsers

## What problems does Flexbox solve?

- Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent

- Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height, regardless of how much width/height is available

- Making all columns in a multiple column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different amount of content
