Follow the steps below to complete Milestone #2:

In pairs (or groups):

1. Plan out your breakpoint(s) (only one is required for this lab, but you can add more)
2. Optional (but highly recommended): Update existing html and css to fit existing site (wide layout) into a grid


Timebox: 60 minutes


Note: While you will be working with a partner, each student should have their own copy of the project on their computers
