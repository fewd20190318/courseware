- Using Sublime, open the folder called **traffic_light** (found within the **starter_code**) folder

- Instructions

  - Fix the broken code

  - Use "pattern matching" to identify what needs to be changed / added

  - Work in pairs

  - Your job is to fix this code:

  - The yellow button changes the bulb to purple and the green light does not work, change the code so that the traffic light works correctly.
